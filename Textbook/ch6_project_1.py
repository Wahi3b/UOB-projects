'''
Package Newtonâ€™s method for approximating square roots (Case Study 3.6) in a
function named newton. This function expects the input number as an argument
and returns the estimate of its square root. The script should also include a main
function that allows the user to compute square roots of inputs until she presses
the enter/return key.
